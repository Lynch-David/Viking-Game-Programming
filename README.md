# Final Project

-   [ ] Read the [project requirements](https://vikramsinghmtl.github.io/420-5P6-Game-Programming/project/requirements).
-   [ ] Replace the sample proposal below with the one for your game idea.
-   [ ] Get the proposal greenlit by Vik.
-   [ ] Place any assets in `assets/` and remember to update `src/config.json`.
-   [ ] Decide on a height and width inside `src/globals.js`. The height and width will most likely be determined based on the size of the assets you find.
-   [ ] Start building the individual components of your game, constantly referring to the proposal you wrote to keep yourself on track.
-   [ ] Good luck, you got this!

# Sample Proposal - Pok√©mon the Trading Card Game

> [!note]
> This was taken from a project I did in university so the scope is **much** larger than what I'm expecting from you in terms of number of features!

## ‚úíÔ∏è Description

In this platformer game, the player assumes the role of a Viking who's goal is to climb to the top of a structure to reach his lost booze. The map is a vertical scroller meaning that the Viking can only load the next level by getting high enough, these 'levels' are more so stages taht work together as one big map that continuously climbs upwards. There is no lose condition only the win condition of reaching the top of the structure, however beware, as falling will lead you to be heavily punished and fall down multiple stages at times. Take your time, or else you'll learn true frustration...

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay

Players will begin by being loaded into a new world trapped within two never ending walls on either side with their only way to get out is to go from platform to platform reaching as high as possible. There are only five keys that can be used to control your character in this game. A/LEFT ARROW will point your character to the left, D/RIGHT ARROW will point your character to the right and finally SPACE will cause your character to jump. All of these put together allows you to jump in two directions while being able to walk around slightly. The vertical and horizontal distance you can cover solely depends on how long your jump was charged for. Meaning the longer you hold SPACE the further you can reach. The mechanic that adds a challenge to this game is the fact that you must get a feel for how long you have held your jump for as there is no indication for this.

The Viking will only land on flat platforms, if hit a slanted structure prepare for a long fall. Furthermore, another key mechanic of the game is to be able to bounce off of walls, by doing so you can change your velocity midair, you'll need to use this at certain points throughout the levels. After reaching the top of your structure, that's it, you've won!

This is a recreation of the game *Jump King*, it is a single player game that is played with direction keys and SPACE for jumping.

### ü§ñ State Diagram

> Remember that you'll need diagrams for not only game states but entity states as well.

### üßµ Wireframes

> [!note]
> Your wireframes don't have to be super polished. They can even be black/white and hand drawn. I'm just looking for a rough idea about what you're visualizing.

![Main Menu](./assets/images/Main-Menu.png)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/804ebcfb-fa0c-4b04-8828-76d2579cd13b)


-   _Let's Play_ will navigate to the main game.
-   _Upload Cards_ will navigation to the forms for uploading and parsing the data files for the game.
-   _Change Log_ will navigate the user to a page with a list of features/changes that have been implemented throughout the development of the game.

![Game Board](./assets/images/Game-Board.png)

We want to keep the GUI as simple and clear as possible by having cards with relevant images to act as a way for the user to intuitively navigate the game. We want to implement a layout that would look like as if one were playing a match of the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game with physical cards in real life. Clicking on any of the cards will reveal that card's details to the player.

### üé® Assets

We used [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create the wireframes. Wireframes are the equivalent to the skeleton of a web app since they are used to describe the functionality of the product and the users experience.

We plan on following trends already found in other trading card video games, such as Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Online, Hearthstone, Magic the Gathering Arena, and Gwent.

The GUI will be kept simple and playful, as to make sure the game is easy to understand what each component does and is, as well as light hearted to keep to the Pok√©mon theme.

#### üñºÔ∏è Images

-   Most images will be used from the well known community driven wikipedia site, [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page).
-   Especially their [Trading Card Game section](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Full_Art_card_(TCG)>).

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Fonts

For fonts, a simple sans-serif like Roboto will look quite nice. It's a font that is legible, light on storage size, and fun to keep with the theme we're going for. We also used a more cartoonish Pokemon font for the title screen.

#### üîä Sounds

All sounds were taken from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) for the actions pertaining to cards.
