## ‚úíÔ∏è Description

In this platformer game, the player assumes the role of a Viking who's goal is to climb to the top of a structure to reach his lost booze. The map is a vertical scroller meaning that the Viking can only load the next level by getting high enough, these 'levels' are more so stages taht work together as one big map that continuously climbs upwards. There is no lose condition only the win condition of reaching the top of the structure, however beware, as falling will lead you to be heavily punished and fall down multiple stages at times. Take your time, or else you'll learn true frustration...

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay

Players will begin by being loaded into a new world trapped within two never ending walls on either side with their only way to get out is to go from platform to platform reaching as high as possible. There are only five keys that can be used to control your character in this game. A/LEFT ARROW will point your character to the left, D/RIGHT ARROW will point your character to the right and finally SPACE will cause your character to jump. All of these put together allows you to jump in two directions while being able to walk around slightly. The vertical and horizontal distance you can cover solely depends on how long your jump was charged for. Meaning the longer you hold SPACE the further you can reach. The mechanic that adds a challenge to this game is the fact that you must get a feel for how long you have held your jump for as there is no indication for this.

The Viking will only land on flat platforms, if hit a slanted structure prepare for a long fall. Furthermore, another key mechanic of the game is to be able to bounce off of walls, by doing so you can change your velocity midair, you'll need to use this at certain points throughout the levels. After reaching the top of your structure, that's it, you've won!

This is a recreation of the game *Jump King*, it is a single player game that is played with direction keys and SPACE for jumping.
